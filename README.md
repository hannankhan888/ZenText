# ZenText - A Simple Text Editor
This is a very basic text editor written in Python 3. The purpose of this editor was to learn the fundamentals of Python 3, along withdeveloping my first application.

The library used to make the GUI is tkinter, and a dependency is required (tkfontchooser; for selecting fonts).
