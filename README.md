# ZenText - A Simple Text Editor
This is a very basic text editor written in Python 3. The purpose of this editor was to learn the fundamentals of Python 3, along with developing my first application.

## Installation

Use the pip package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependencies listed in requirements.txt. Currently, only one dependency is required, all others are part of the tkinter library.
## Usage

This is a standalone application.
