# ZenText - A Simple Text Editor
This is a very basic text editor written in Python 3. The purpose of this editor was to learn the fundamentals of Python 3, along with developing my first application.

## Installation
If you would like to use ZenText immediately, you can use the .exe file located within the dist folder.
To get the code to compile, use the pip package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependencies listed in requirements.txt. Currently, only one dependency is required, all others are part of the tkinter library. The source code can be found in the ZenText.py file.
## Usage

This is a standalone application.
